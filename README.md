# 2D6_tools
 dice, combat, room creation scripts written in Python
 
 The scripts try to automate some of the steps in D26 dungeon single player TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game)
 
 These scripts are my work and not authorised, sanctioned or condoned by the D26 dungeon author Toby Lancaster.  If you have any question about errors in the scripts they are completely my fault.

To run the scripts copy the 4 files into same directory and then run using the following command:

python3 2d6Dice.py


Background
==========

These scripts have been written as I am dabbling in learning Python, so they will be buggy, not efficient, and break Python best programming practise.  
When learning a new programming language, I need to work on a project.  
With my style I don't find reading a book, listening to a lecture and then doing some tutorials a very good way for me to absorb a language.

Vidoes of the creation of the game were recommended to my Youtube watch list. 
I have no idea why Youtube recommended the videos but I could see that there was the start for a possible project, so here it is.
